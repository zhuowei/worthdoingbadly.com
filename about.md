This is a blog where I create - and document - something new with code every week.

While reading [Burgis' blog](https://www.stephanieburgis.com/2018/01/new-year-new-re-discoveries/), I came across this quote:

> If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.

> &mdash; G. K. Chesterton

This resonated with me: in the last few years, I didn't start enough projects, because I thought that everything I make must be turned into a product. Thus, I'm giving myself a chance to try new technology without worrying about making it deployable, reliable, monetizable, or even work at all. It's an opportunity to challenge myself, fail a few times, and document the lessons.
